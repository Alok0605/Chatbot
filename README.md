# Chatbot
Basically used to solve some basic problems.
📌 Project Description

This project implements a simple Rule-Based Chatbot using C++.
The chatbot responds to user input based on predefined keyword-matching rules.

It simulates basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) using string handling and conditional logic.

Objective :-

The goal of this project is to:

Understand basic conversational AI concepts

Implement keyword-based pattern matching

Use loops and conditional logic in C++

Simulate a simple chatbot interaction

How It Works :-


The program takes user input.

Converts input to lowercase.

Searches for specific keywords using string::find().

Matches the input with predefined rules.

Returns an appropriate response.

Continues until the user types exit.


Concepts Used :-

C++ String Handling

string::find() function

string::npos

Loops (while)

Conditional statements (if-else)

Basic NLP idea (Rule-Based Matching)
